## Chirper (Front End)
### Instructions
Your objective should be to create a "timeline" of Chirps -- short messages that you post on the Chirper platform.

Your timeline should load with at least three chirps, and your users need the capability of posting new Chirps, which will be displayed back to them in the timeline once they are posted.

Design constraint: You can only invoke ReactDOM.render() one time in your entire application.

#### Getting Started
Familiarize yourself with your new React application, but quickly move into separating components into their own directory.
Remember: one component per file!

Convert your .js files into .jsx files.

Use only Bootstrap classes. You should not need any custom CSS in this project.

Think about the design of your project. How will you compose (or extract) components to achieve the desired result?

Happy Hacking!
